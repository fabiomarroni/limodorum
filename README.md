Analysis of Gene expression of mychorrized and non-mychorrized Limodorum specimens
Scripts and functions used for data analysis in the paper by Valadares et al 2020. The scripts and functions should be generally executed in numerical order. Shell scripts are used to call the R functions with the needed parameters. We do not provide them as a pipeline expected to work smoothly (although it should!), but rather as a reference to inspect the method and eventually copy the parts that you find useful for your own work. Comments welcome!
